# RemixIconSwapper

A small World of Warcraft addon for the Legion Remix

## What it does

This addon automatically scans your equipped gear in the neck, ring, and trinket slots. If an item grants a recognized spell, the addon will replace the item's default icon with the icon of the spell it grants. This makes it easier to see at a glance which spell-granting items you have equipped.

When an item is unequipped, the icon automatically reverts to the default empty slot.

## Installation

1.  Download the latest version of the addon.
2.  Unzip the downloaded file.
3.  Copy the `RemixIconSwapper` folder into your `World of Warcraft\_retail_\Interface\AddOns` directory.
4.  Restart World of Warcraft. The addon should be enabled by default.
